# Welcome to Coding using Git! We all have to edit this same file.

# Update the students list with your name in alphabetical order by first name.
# This list will increase as more students complete the assignment.
# Example: students = ['Fiz Ban', 'Foo bar']
students = ['Vadym Kharchenko']
professor = ['Gary Kane']
course = ['CSC 131']

print("%s's %s is the best!" % (professor[0], course[0]))
print("Students: %s" % ', '.join(map(str, students)))

# Run the program and make sure it works!
# You can use a simple online IDE if you don't have a Python3
# Example: https://ideone.com/l/python-3
